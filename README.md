# Getting Started with ASP.NET Core

ASP.NET Core (previously known as ASP.NET 5) is a new open-source ([github.com/aspnet/home](https://github.com/aspnet/home)) and cross-platform framework for building modern web apps using .NET. It is a significant redesign of ASP.NET that is being built from the ground up to provide an optimized development framework for apps that are either deployed to the cloud or run on-premises. You can develop and run your ASP.NET Core apps cross-platform on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

In this talk, we'll review the development history of ASP.NET Core, set up our development environment, explore the .NET Core (dotnet) CLI, and create a simple appâ€“from the command line and using Visual Studio. Along the way, we'll also take a look at some of the key new concepts and features that are part of ASP.NET Core.
